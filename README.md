# Cosmo-Meter: Cosmic Event Detector

## Overview
**Cosmo-Meter** is an open-source cosmic event detection tool that uses digital camera sensors (CMOS or CCD) to detect **muons, cosmic rays, and other high-energy particle interactions**. By analyzing a time series of dark frames, it identifies transient bright pixel events that are likely caused by charged particles passing through the sensor. Use at least a 1000 dark images. The more, the better.

## What Can It Detect?
- **Most Likely Detections:**
  - **Muons** (from cosmic ray showers)
  - **High-energy protons and electrons**
  - **Secondary cosmic rays from air showers**

- **Possible Detections:**
  - **Radioactive decay events (beta particles, X-rays) in specific environments**
  - **High-energy gamma-ray interactions producing electron-positron pairs**
  - **Neutron-induced ionization (rare, but possible)**

- **What It Cannot Detect:**
  - **Neutrinos**
  - **Dark matter or exotic physics (unless they interact in an unknown way)**

## How It Works
Cosmo-Meter processes a sequence of dark frames (images taken in complete darkness) and:
1. **Identifies transient bright pixels** that appear in a single frame but disappear in subsequent frames.
2. **Detects streaks** (possible cosmic ray tracks across multiple pixels).
3. **Filters out hot pixels** (sensor defects that remain bright across many/ 0.5% frames).
4. **Logs detected cosmic events** with their coordinates and timestamps.

## Installation
### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Required Libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib tifffile
  ```

## Usage
### Capture Dark Frames
1. Use a digital camera (CMOS/CCD) with the lens covered.
2. Capture a series of **dark frames** at a fixed exposure time (e.g., 30ms to 1s).
3. Save them in a folder (e.g., `dark_frames/`).

### Run Cosmo-Meter
```bash
python cosmometer.py --image_folder path/to/dark_frames --output cosmo-meter_events.csv
```

### Interpretation of Results
The script outputs:  
- Total detected cosmic particle events  
- Streaks (tracks across multiple pixels)  
- Cosmic event flux per pixel per second -> updtaed to per day
- If sensor dimensions are provided, flux per mmÂ² per second -> updated to per day

A **CSV file** (`cosmometer_events.csv`) logs:  
- Frame Number  
- X Coordinate  
- Y Coordinate  
For each detected cosmic event.

Graphical outputs include:  

1. **Event heatmaps**  
   - Hot pixels (persistent bright pixels that could be artifacts)  
   - Streaks (tracks from high-energy cosmic rays)  
   - Total detected cosmic events overlaid on the sensor data

2. **Scatter plot of detected cosmic events over time**  
   - X, Y position of events  
   - Frame number as colorbar (shows when they occurred over time)

3. **Streak map visualization**  
   - Time (frame number) on X-axis  
   - Y-axis as streak coordinate (tracks cosmic rays over time)
